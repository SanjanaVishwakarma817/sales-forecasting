# Sales Forecasting Model

This project builds a time-series forecasting model using historical sales data to predict future demand. The goal is to assist businesses with inventory planning and improve demand prediction accuracy.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- The dataset includes date, sales, and other related features.
- Used a retail dataset from Kaggle / synthetic data for demonstration purposes.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Matplotlib for visualization

## âœ… Key Features
- Time-based features: month, day of week, weekend indicator
- Lag feature: previous dayâ€™s sales
- Rolling average to capture trends
- Comparison with baseline prediction using lag values

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Random Forest model achieved a **15% improvement** over baseline.
- Visualized actual vs predicted sales to showcase model accuracy.
